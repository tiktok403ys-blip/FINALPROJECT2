-- Migration: Documentation for search_path security fixes
-- Purpose: Document all changes made to fix search_path security vulnerabilities

-- Summary: Complete documentation of security improvements

/*
=== SEARCH_PATH SECURITY FIX DOCUMENTATION ===

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Function public.update_updated_at_column had mutable search_path
- This created security vulnerabilities where malicious users could:
  * Manipulate search_path to redirect function calls to malicious objects
  * Cause function to access unintended tables or functions
  * Create inconsistent behavior across different sessions

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Added explicit SET search_path = 'public, pg_catalog' to the function
2. This ensures the function always uses a secure, predictable search path
3. Prevents search_path manipulation attacks
4. Maintains function compatibility with existing triggers

MIGRATIONS APPLIED:
- 20241230000024: Initial analysis of function status
- 20241230000025: Applied security fix with explicit search_path
- 20241230000026: Audited all functions for similar issues
- 20241230000027: Verified the fix was applied correctly
- 20241230000028: Tested trigger functionality after fix
- 20241230000029: This documentation

SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS:
✓ Function now has explicit search_path = 'public, pg_catalog'
✓ Prevents search_path manipulation attacks
✓ Ensures consistent behavior across all sessions
✓ Maintains backward compatibility with existing triggers
✓ Function still works correctly as a trigger function

BEST PRACTICES APPLIED:
1. Explicit search_path setting for security
2. Use of 'public, pg_catalog' for standard PostgreSQL objects
3. Comprehensive testing of trigger functionality
4. Audit of other functions for similar issues
5. Proper documentation of changes

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE:
1. Always set explicit search_path for new functions
2. Regular audits of existing functions for security issues
3. Use schema-qualified names when possible
4. Apply SECURITY DEFINER only when necessary
5. Document security-related changes thoroughly

FUNCTION AFTER FIX:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS trigger
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SET search_path = 'public, pg_catalog'  -- Security fix applied
AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at := now();
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;
```

TESTING PERFORMED:
✓ Function definition verification
✓ Search_path configuration check
✓ Trigger functionality test
✓ Audit of other functions
✓ Security verification

STATUS: COMPLETED
All security issues related to search_path mutability have been resolved.
The function is now secure and maintains full functionality.

-- Add final verification comment to the function
COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.update_updated_at_column() IS 
'Trigger function to automatically update updated_at column. '
'SECURITY: Uses explicit search_path for security (fixed 2024-12-30). '
'Prevents search_path manipulation attacks while maintaining full compatibility.';
